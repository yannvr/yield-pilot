# Protocol Integration Status

## Overview

This document outlines the current status of protocol plugin integration into the YieldPilot CLI. The goal is to ensure that the CLI relies exclusively on actual protocol data rather than fallback values or simulated data.

## Completed Integrations

1. **protocol-lido**
   - Integrated with The Graph for fetching Lido protocol data
   - Provides real-time APR, TVL, and other metrics for stETH
   - Fully integrated into `src/protocols/index.js`

2. **protocol-aave**
   - Integrated with The Graph for fetching Aave V3 protocol data
   - Provides real-time supply rates, borrow rates, LTV ratios, and other metrics
   - Fully integrated into `src/protocols/index.js`

## Pending Integrations

The following protocol plugins still need to be created and integrated:

1. **protocol-renzo**
   - Status: âœ… Data fetching implemented (The Graph with DefiLlama fallback).
   - Will fetch APY boost, TVL, and fees.
   - Will use Renzo's API or subgraph.
   - Priority: High (Data fetching done, analysis/steps refinement pending).

2. **protocol-kelp**
   - Will fetch APY boost, TVL, and fees
   - Will use Kelp's API or subgraph
   - Priority: High

3. **protocol-eigenlayer**
   - Will fetch base APR and TVL
   - Will use EigenLayer's API or subgraph
   - Priority: Medium

4. **protocol-yearn**
   - Will fetch vault APYs and TVL
   - Will use Yearn's API or subgraph
   - Priority: Medium

5. **protocol-uniswap**
   - Will fetch pool data, liquidity, and fees
   - Will use Uniswap's API or subgraph
   - Priority: Low

6. **protocol-gas**
   - Will fetch current gas prices and estimate gas costs
   - Will use Blocknative API and Etherscan as fallback
   - Priority: Medium

## Next Steps

1. Create and implement the protocol-kelp plugin.
   - Use `scripts/create-plugin.js` to create the plugin.
   - Implement the `getProtocolData()` function.
   - Update `src/protocols/index.js` to integrate the plugin.

2. Refine `analyzeStrategy` and `getRequiredSteps` for `protocol-lido`, `protocol-aave`, and `protocol-renzo`.
   - Ensure these functions use the fetched data accurately and provide meaningful insights/steps.
   - Map specific contract addresses and method names.

3. Create and implement the protocol-eigenlayer plugin.
   - Follow the same process as for protocol-kelp.

4. Update the CLI to display the data source for each protocol
   - Add a new section to the CLI output that shows which data sources are being used
   - Highlight when real protocol data is being used vs. fallback data

5. Add error handling for when protocol plugins fail
   - Ensure graceful fallback to DefiLlama data when possible
   - Provide clear warnings to the user when fallback data is being used

6. Create a test suite for protocol plugins
   - Test each plugin individually
   - Test the integrated system with the CLI

## Required API Keys

The following API keys need to be added to the `.env` file:

```
THEGRAPH_API_KEY=your_graph_api_key
BLOCKNATIVE_API_KEY=your_blocknative_api_key
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key
INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_api_key  # Optional, for direct RPC queries
```

## Conclusion

The integration of protocol-lido and protocol-aave plugins is a significant step toward ensuring that the YieldPilot CLI relies exclusively on actual protocol data. Continuing with the integration of the remaining protocol plugins will further enhance the accuracy and reliability of the CLI's recommendations.
