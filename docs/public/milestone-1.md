# Milestone 1: Core CLI MVP

## Overview
EigenPilot's first milestone establishes a robust CLI-based simulation and execution engine for DeFi strategies. This foundation enables AI-powered strategy recommendations with real-time yield projections and comprehensive risk analysis.

## Key Features
- CLI app with `simulate` command (future: `exec`)
- Interactive prompts for strategy parameters
- Real-time yield calculations
- Protocol-aware strategy recommendations
- Gas + borrow cost estimation
- Net yield calculation (gross - fees)
- AI commentary per strategy
- Simple to use with JSON output option

## Technical Implementation
- CLI interface: `src/cli/index.js`
- Strategy analyzer: `src/analyzer/index.js`
- Protocol data: `src/protocols/index.js`
- Yield projections: `src/projections/index.js`
- Market insights: `src/insights/index.js`

## AI Integration
- Uses `strategyAgentPrompt.txt` for AI-powered strategy analysis
- Structured YAML for simulation data
- Comprehensive risk assessment
- Context-aware strategy recommendations

## Future Roadmap
- Modular plugin framework for extensible simulation and scoring
- Web interface integration with shared core logic
- Strategy execution tracking and performance monitoring
- AVS compatibility for validator and dApp integration
