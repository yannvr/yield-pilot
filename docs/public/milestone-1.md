# YieldPilot Milestone 1: Building the Foundation for Smart DeFi Simulation

We're excited to announce the completion of **Milestone 1** for YieldPilot, our CLI-first DeFi strategist! This phase laid the critical groundwork for simulating complex DeFi strategies with a strong emphasis on real-world data and transparency.

## The Goal: Accurate Forecasting from Day One

From the start, YieldPilot's mission has been clear: provide users with accurate, data-driven insights into potential DeFi strategies *before* they commit real assets. Milestone 1 focused on building the core engine to achieve this. We aimed to create a tool that could:

1.  Simulate basic strategies, initially targeting ETH liquid staking ([Lido](https://lido.fi/)) and potential restaking routes ([Renzo](https://www.renzoprotocol.com/), [Kelp DAO](https://kelpdao.xyz/), [EigenLayer](https://www.eigenlayer.xyz/)).
2.  Incorporate real-time on-chain data for crucial factors like yield ([Yearn Finance](https://yearn.finance/), Lido) and gas costs ([Blocknative](https://www.blocknative.com/), [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)).
3.  Clearly communicate the reliability of the data used in simulations.

## What We Built: Key Features in Milestone 1

This milestone saw the development of several core components:

*   **The `simulate` Command:** We introduced the foundational `yield-pilot simulate` command, allowing users to kick off strategy analysis directly from their terminal.
*   **Real-Time Data Integration:** YieldPilot now pulls data from key sources:
    *   [DefiLlama](https://defillama.com/) provides baseline protocol data (TVL, APRs) for Lido, [Aave](https://aave.com/), Renzo, Kelp, and Yearn vault APYs.
    *   [Blocknative](https://www.blocknative.com/) offers primary real-time gas fee estimates.
    *   [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) serves as a reliable fallback for gas data.
    *   API keys are securely managed using `.env` files.
*   **Dynamic Strategy Engine:** We moved beyond static examples. The new `strategyBuilder` dynamically constructs potential strategy routes based on the latest fetched data (like Lido's stETH APR and Aave's borrowing/lending rates). It calculates projected yields and generates contextual insights tailored to the proposed route.
*   **Data Source Transparency:** Trust is paramount. The CLI output now explicitly flags whether a key metric (like gas cost or an APR) is using 'Real Data' or a 'Fallback Value' (often a placeholder until full integration is complete). Color-coding and warnings help users quickly assess simulation reliability.

## Technical Corner

Under the hood, Milestone 1 involved:

*   Setting up the Node.js project using `pnpm`.
*   Implementing robust asynchronous fetching from multiple external APIs.
*   Refactoring the core analysis logic for dynamic, data-driven operation.

## Looking Ahead: What's Next for YieldPilot?

Milestone 1 built the chassis; now we start adding more horsepower! While integrations like [1inch](https://app.1inch.io/) (for swap analysis) and advanced AI insights (potentially via [Bittensor](https://bittensor.com/)) were deferred to keep Phase 1 focused, they are high on our priority list.

Future milestones will concentrate on:

*   Integrating swap simulation (cost, slippage) via 1inch.
*   Developing the `exec` command for actual strategy execution (securely!).
*   Adding more sophisticated AI/ML-driven forecasting.
*   Supporting more complex, multi-step strategies like leveraged looping.
*   Continuously refining the CLI experience and data visualizations.

Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to build YieldPilot into the most insightful and transparent DeFi co-pilot available!
