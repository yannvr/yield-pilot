# Milestone 1: Core Forecasting & Simulation Engine

## Overview

Milestone 1 focused on establishing the foundational forecasting and simulation capabilities of YieldPilot. The goal was to create a robust CLI tool capable of evaluating basic DeFi strategies (initially focusing on ETH liquid staking and restaking potential) using real-time on-chain data for yield and gas, while clearly indicating data reliability.

## Key Features & Improvements

*   **CLI Framework:** Implemented the basic `eigen-pilot simulate` command structure using Node.js.
*   **Protocol Integration (Data Fetching):**
    *   Integrated DefiLlama to fetch core data (APRs, TVL) for Lido, Aave, Renzo, and Kelp.
    *   Integrated Yearn Finance data via DefiLlama for vault APY analysis.
    *   Integrated Blocknative API for real-time gas price estimation (`BLOCKNATIVE_API_KEY`).
    *   Added Etherscan API as a fallback for gas estimation (`ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`).
    *   Set up `dotenv` for secure API key management.
*   **Dynamic Strategy Analyzer:**
    *   Replaced static mock AI logic (`mockAI.js`) with a dynamic `strategyBuilder.js`.
    *   Implemented dynamic route generation based on fetched protocol data (e.g., Lido APR, Aave rates, placeholder Renzo/Kelp boosts).
    *   Generated dynamic insights and yield projections based on the constructed route.
*   **Data Reliability Flagging:**
    *   Modified CLI output to clearly distinguish between 'Real Data' and 'Fallback Value' for key metrics.
    *   Added a warning message when fallback data is used.
    *   Used `chalk` for color-coded terminal output indicating data source reliability.
*   **Documentation:** Updated `README.md` and `docs/ROADMAP.md` to reflect the Phase 1 scope and deferred features.

## Technical Highlights

*   Established Node.js + `pnpm` project structure.
*   Implemented asynchronous data fetching from multiple external APIs (DefiLlama, Blocknative, Etherscan).
*   Refactored core analysis logic from static mocks to dynamic data-driven functions.
*   Utilized environment variables for API key management.

## Deferred/Excluded

*   **1inch Integration:** Deferred due to API key availability delays. Swap simulation/optimization not included in this phase.
*   **Advanced AI/Forecasting:** Allora integration excluded due to service uncertainty. Bittensor integration deferred due to setup requirements.
*   **Complex Strategies:** Aave + DeFi Saver looping deferred to a later phase.
*   **Execution (`exec` command):** Focus remained solely on simulation (`simulate`).

## What's Next (Phase 2 Ideas)

*   Integrate 1inch for swap simulation and cost analysis.
*   Implement the `exec` command for strategy execution (requires wallet integration).
*   Integrate a dedicated AI/ML model (e.g., Bittensor via microservice) for enhanced insights and forecasting.
*   Add support for more complex multi-step strategies (e.g., looping).
*   Refine UI/UX of the CLI output.
*   Implement robust error handling and input validation.
